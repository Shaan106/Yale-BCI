// Latency: 5625 clock cycles
// Throughput: 1 transform every 5141 cycles


// We use an interleaved complex data format.  X0 represents the
// real portion of the first input, and X1 represents the imaginary
// portion.  The X variables are system inputs and the Y variables
// are system outputs.

// The design uses a system of flag signals to indicate the
// beginning of the input and output data streams.  The 'next'
// input (asserted high), is used to instruct the system that the
// input stream will begin on the following cycle.

// This system has a 'gap' of 5141 cycles.  This means that
// 5141 cycles must elapse between the beginning of the input
// vectors.

// The output signal 'next_out' (also asserted high) indicates
// that the output vector will begin streaming out of the system
 // on the following cycle.

// The system has a latency of 5625 cycles.  This means that
// the 'next_out' will be asserted 5625 cycles after the user
// asserts 'next'.

// The simple testbench below will demonstrate the timing for loading
// and unloading data vectors.
// The system reset signal is asserted high.

// Please note: when simulating floating point code, you must include
// Xilinx's DSP slice simulation module.
